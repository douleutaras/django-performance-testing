# NOTE: the downside here is that we will not be able to control the order
#       of the limits as they get applied. Thus this - or alternatively, a
#       decorator based approach wouldn't be right, as one might want to
#       be explicit about what context will be shown for what. So probably
#       a settings (with meaningful default) + some diagnostics code (that
#       would warn if a given class is not present in settings/is duplicate)
#       should be more hepful
